# webhacking.kr

My solutions to challenges from [webhacking.kr](https://webhacking.kr).  

**Whatâ€™s inside?**  
- Each challenge has its own folder.  
- Contains `solution.md` with a detailed explanation and analysis.  
- Includes scripts (e.g., `solution.py`) if needed to solve the challenge.  
- Additional files (if required) from the challenge itself.  

Feel free to explore and use as a reference!
